# Tabroom-Seed-Creator
creates the seeds based on tournament prelims assuming speaks have been realesed

If the speaks have been realesed before the breaks/seeds have been posted, use this to calculate seeds. 
Enter the URL of any prelim round pairing when prompted (make sure to include the https:// part)
  ex: https://www.tabroom.com/index/tourn/postings/round.mhtml?tourn_id=13121&round_id=440666

wait a bit and it should list out the seeds from first to last

current priority list of seeds is wins then speaks -h/l

more tiebreaking priorities will come late
